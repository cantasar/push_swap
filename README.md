## Algorithm

For the stacks with size less than 6 I wrote a simple sort which can be found in the src folder.

In this project I used `Radix` sort as the main algorithm. `Radix` sort is an efficient algorithm to sort non-negative integers
with time complexity O (n). For example, we can sort following list of integers with this algorithm
